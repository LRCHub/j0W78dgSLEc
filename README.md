```lrc
[00:29.61] Thinking of you
[00:32.38] All through the morning
[00:35.00] I'm thinking of you
[00:37.75] All through the evening
[00:40.45] I'm thinking of you
[00:43.25] And the way that your holy water grew
[01:01.75] 
[00:52.35] I met a girl under the water
[00:57.78] It made me recall how I wanted a daughter
[01:04.02] But you never gave me nothing that I could hold on to
[01:30.52] 
[01:15.82] But I wrote you letters by the phone
[01:21.23] And I wrote you every night alone
[01:27.58] But who are you walking around with
[01:32.83] Buttercup
[01:37.33] 
[01:42.60] He was my lord
[01:45.32] And I was his lady
[01:48.03] But I soon grew tired of the lazy days
[01:54.38] When I moved away and I thought of him often
[01:59.87] He came to me nights in my rose colored dreams
[02:22.87] 
[02:10.66] Thinking of you
[02:13.39] All through the morning
[02:16.03] I'm thinking of you
[02:18.87] All through the evening
[02:22.56] I'm thinking of you
[02:25.25] And the way that your holy water grew
[02:43.75] 
[02:33.13] But I wrote you letters by the phone
[02:39.46] And I wrote you every night alone
[02:45.84] But who are you walking around with
[02:51.20] Buttercup
