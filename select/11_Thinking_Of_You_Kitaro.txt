(It's been a long time baby)
(But I'll keep on waiting whole the night)
Only you, everything
(Still I can't way to let you go)
(Cause you'll always be my baby luv luv luv)

(It's only luv)
Just thinking of you, well, well, well, everytime
(Losing control)
もう、thinking of you, 痛いくらい辛い oh
(Why don't you cry)
Just thinking of you, pain, pain, pain,
I want to cry もう、気がついてよ
きみ以外 考えられない...

このままじゃへこむよ
このままlosing you
私は親友で かたづけるの
その彼女の話 聞かされそうで
逃げ出したくなるよ
Don't let me down
冷静にはなれない
かかえている想い
どうやって伝えれば
まだ間に合うの?

(It's only luv)
Just thinking of you, only you, everything
(Losing control)
もう、thinking of you, love, love, love, oh
(Why don't you cry)
Just thinking of you, only you,
I want to cry ねえ、近くにいて
こんなにも 想ってるのに...

ずっと見てる夢も
微妙な癖も
きみの優しささえ
知りすぎてる 友達が長いと
無理なのfall in love
勝手に恋心 育ててた
この胸あふれだす
ギリギリの気持ち
どんな魔法かければ
きみに届くの?

(It's only luv)
Just thinking of you, well, well, well, everytime
(Losing control)
もう、 thinking of you, 痛いくらい辛い oh
(Why don't you cry)
Just thinking of you, pain, pain, pain,
I want to cry もう、気づいてほしい
いますぐ I wish, I miss you

(It's been a long time baby)
(But I'll keep on waiting whole the night)
(Still I can't way to let you go)
(Cause you'll always be my baby luv luv luv)

(It's only luv)
Just thinking of you, only you, everything
(Losing control) もう、thinking of you,
Love, love, love, oh
(Why don't you cry)
Just thinking of you, only you,
I want to cry ねえ、近くにいて
こんなにも 想って

(It's only luv)
Just thinking of you, well, well, well, everytime
(Losing control)
もう、thinking of you, 痛いくらい辛い oh
(Why don't you cry)
Just thinking of you, pain, pain, pain,
I want to cry もう、 気づいてほしい いますぐ
ねえ、近くにいて こんなにも 想ってるのに...

Just thinking of you,
Only you, everything
Only you, everything
Just thinking of you...
